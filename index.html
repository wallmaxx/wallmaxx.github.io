        <h3>You are frustrated with Traffic!</h3>
        <img src="frustrated-guy.jpg">
        <p>Seattle traffic is fifth worst in the entire United States! The average metro commuter spends over eighty hours a year stuck in traffic jams. Billions of dollars are lost each year on delays through the I-5 corridor, and no one is free from the stress of their daily commute. We at Traffic Freedom know you've been stuck in traffic for more hours of your life than you'd like to count, and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it.</p>
